# eto-warehouses
Grist has compiled a list of warehouses to inform the public about potential sources of ethylene oxide, a toxic chemical. The list includes two types of warehouses:

1. Those that we confirmed store medical products and therefore likely emit some amount of the chemical. These are labeled as “confirmed” warehouses. Information about these warehouses was gathered from records requests to the Environmental Protection Agency and the South Coast Air Quality Managment District and by speaking with truck drivers transporting sterilized products. 

2. Those that are used by major medical device manufacturers and distributors and could be storing equipment sterilized with ethylene oxide. These are labeled as “potential” warehouses. Some of these companies have reported to state or federal regulators that they operate at least one distribution center that stores products sterilized with ethylene oxide. Others were identified in person by Grist reporters as recipients of products from sterilization facilities. But since companies use multiple sterilization methods, it’s unclear whether each of these emits ethylene oxide. However, Grist still chose to publish the information to demonstrate the scale of the potential problem and for local reporters and residents who may want to do their own research.
